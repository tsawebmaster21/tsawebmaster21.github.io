								<h3 align="middle"><b>Our Backstory</b></h3>
								<p align="middle">The band came together when the artists were all about 21. Addison was still living in Tennessee, but Noah and Elijah both lived in New York. The boys both went to apply to become the main act at this bar in the city. The two of them started talking after that night because they both felt each of them were really good at their craft, Elijah on guitar and Noah on drums respectively. As the two of them started to become closer, they wanted to create a band. At the time they just so happened to stumble upon Addison’s Instagram page, and Noah reached out to her. He said they were looking to create a legitimate band. He said they wanted to fly out and meet me to see if we had musical chemistry. So, that’s exactly what they did. They all ended up really liking each other and after many hours of debate they decided to call themselves “Juniper Valley”.</p>

								<h4><b>Addison - Lead Singer</b></h4>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images\femalesinger.jpg" alt="" /></span>My name is Addison, I’m from Tennessee, and I am the singer of the band Juniper Valley. I became interested in music at a very young age. My mom was a singer so it ran in the family, but she taught me tips and trick as I was getting older. Unfortunately, I lost my mom when I was 16. She was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer and battled with it for three years before passing away. I stopped singing after that. It reminded me too much of her and I just couldn’t get myself to do it. My dad was always a big supporter of getting me back into singing. He ended up finding an opening for an artist to come sing at the hospital my mom stayed in. As I was singing in the lobby to the patients, I could see hearing me sing brought them joy. A bunch of them had big smiles on their face and wanted to me come back again. I knew that I just had to get back into music. So, I created an Instagram account and I posted videos of myself singing everywhere. Eventually, more and more places started to contact me, and I guess my popularity started to grow. </p>

								<h4 align="right">Elijah - Guitarist</h4>
								<p align="right"><span class="image right"><img src="images\bassguitar.jpg" alt="" /></span> My name is Elijah, I’m from New York and I am the guitarist for Juniper Valley. I started to play music around the age of 6. I found an old guitar in the garage and I just started to mess around with it. My parents never really supported me playing the guitar. Both of them are fairly successful lawyers, so it was their expectation for me not to be "distracted by music", and to be all about school and attend a high level college. They both felt that playing the guitar would take away from my education, and that I would go nowhere with my life because it was “too much for me to handle”. So, when I was about 20 I moved out and went to go live with a friend in the city. I found some business around the area but it wasn’t the best. I ended up booking a few gigs here and there, but it wasn’t much.</p>

								<h4>Noah - Drummer</h4>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images\ourdrummer.jpg" alt="" /></span>My name is Noah, i’m from California, and I am the drummer for the band Juniper Valley. I don’t have a memorable backstory to as of how I got into music. My parents just said that I had to have an activity to keep me occupied after school and, after not being able to choose, my parents chose drumming. I feel like they just paid for my drum lessons because I have four other siblings and I rarely got attention. Sad I know, but if it wasn’t for them paying for my lessons I wouldn’t be where I am today. I eventually became very good at drumming and I wanted to move to a more musically cultured city. So, I chose New York. I found an apartment and I made a living off of nightly gigs at a bar down the street. </p>
