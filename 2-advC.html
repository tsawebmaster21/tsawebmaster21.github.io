									<h3 class="major">1567: Advanced Multimedia Technology</h3>
									<p>Advanced multimedia technology will bring a students communications skills to the next level. This course builds on former knowledge from introduction classes and allows a student to push those said skills to the limit while working with industry standard equipment. Topics that will be discussed during this course will include audio/video hardware and software, green screen techniques, high-end photography and digital cameras, desktop publishing, imaging software, graphic layout, and printing technologies. This course is built around having small groups of students working together to develop and produce a business marketing plan, incorporating concepts learned while competing amongst other students.</p>
										<br>
										<br>
										<br>
									<h3 class="major">1555: Advanced Robotics & Automation</h3>
									<p>Advanced Robotics & Automation is an excellent class for students interested in robots and automated systems. In this class, students will incorporate STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) into learning how to design, build, program, control, and test numerous robotic devices. Classwork will involve work in mechanics, energy analog/digital electronics, forces, motors, prototyping, and programming. Students will learn about the Engineering Design Process and follow it as they document work and solve problems.</p>
										<br>
										<br>
										<br>
									<h3 class="major">1557: Advanced Technology & Engineering</h3>
									<p>This course is only available to students who have previously completed Technology and Engineering (1547). Advanced Technology and Engineering is building off of knowledge learned in a students first year, taking Technology and Engineering (1547). Activities in this course are more complex and require large blocks of time. Projects are also build off of the concepts of communication, transportation, construction, and manufacturing and may include electronics and programming microcontrollers, robotics, product design and development, engineering design, and modular construction.</p>
										<br>
										<br>
										<br>
									<h3 class="major">1551: Advanced Engineering Design</h3>
									<p>Advanced Engineering Design will use the basic skills learned in Technical Drawing and Design (1542) to create solutions to complicated engineering problems. This course will emphasize the engineering method, a process for developing designs, which will be used to create working prototypes. Some of the various activities are 3D printing, creating clay automobiles, using a wind tunnel, and designing a project that fits the human body.</p>
										<br>
										<br>
										<br>
									<h3 class="major">1553: Advanced Materials Engineering</h3>
									<p>This class is for students who want to further their education in manufacturing. The opportunity to design and build more complex objects and dig deeper into the creation of these products will be offered in this course. Students will also explore cutting edge technologies such as CNC and 3D printing honing in on a students skills as a maker.</p>
