													(communications, materials, design, and engineering) using a problem-solving type
													of advancement. Students also learn to analyze, identify, and use technologies suited
													for everyday life. This class is an excellent way to design and engineer solutions to
													problems, prototype ideas, and express creativity.</p>
														<br><br>
											<h2><b>Intermediate Courses:</b></h2>
											<p><b>1540: Photographic Imaging</b><br>
											This is an engaging course where students learn the fundamentals of photography using
												the state of the art DSLR camera. Some of the assignments in this class include stop
												action, depth of field, along with macro and portrait photography. Students will learn
												to capture sensational photos, edit and print images quickly, and develop quality
												layouts. Also, students will be taught how to use Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom in the
												digital photo lab.</p>

												<p><b>1541: Digital Communications</b><br>
													Digital Communications will help students take a look at how graphics found on everyday objects are made. Students will spend time learning how to put designs on T-shirts, create vinyl graphics and decals for cars and windows, design album covers, and create websites with streaming audio and video. This class also provides instruction on creating graphics, logos, and images that can be edited and used both in print and on the internet. The promotion of businesses, groups, and organizations can be communicated through the knowledge gained in this class.</p>

													<p><b>1559: Residential Design and Modeling</b><br>
														This semester-long class teaches students basic skills to design a remodeling project for a house using Chief Architect. Chief Architect is a 3D design program that students will use to remodel a kitchen, design a deck, develop an interior color scheme, plan for a recreational room, and many more. Student will learn many vital skills needed in order to complete more advanced classes during the course of a semester.</p>

														<p><b>1552: Architectural Design</b><br>
															This course allows students to use a 3D architectural design program, Chief Architect, to solve auxiliary drawing). There will be a big emphasis on problem solving, and learning accuracy, problems related to architecture. Students will develop a general knowledge of interior and exterior design. Also, students will be provided the opportunity to explore architectural concepts including land development, environmental design factors, residential and commercial area planning, and landscape design. This class is a must for students who plan to become an architect, designer, or engineer.</p>

															<p><b>1542: Technical Drawing and Design</b><br>
																This course will focus on the methods, materials, instruments, and techniques of technical drawing. During this class students will work through a progression of technical sketching and board drawing to SolidWorks, 3D printers, and a working drawing (Three-view, section, and pride, efficiency, and productivity.</p>

																<p><b>1544: Materials Engineering</b><br>
																	Materials Engineering is a class centered on making things and creating an understanding of the qualities and characteristics of the materials being utilized. Wood, metal, plastics, glass, and composites are used to produce a variety of items throughout the course. Molding, casting, bending, making precise cuts, turning, welding, and applying finishes are all processes that will be learned during this class. Students will work independently as well as cooperatively with other students. If a student is contemplating a career as a material engineer, manufacturing technician, plant manager, or any related technical professions, this class would be an excellent choice.</p>

																	<p><b>1545: Residential Construction</b><br>
																		This class is an introduction to concepts related to problem solving and engineering. Throughout the year students will experience a variety of challenging activities relating to applied engineering, structural engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering and transportation, electrical and computer engineering, and robotics.

Classwork will involve work in mechanics, energy analog/digital electronics, forces, motors, prototyping, and programming. Students will learn about the Engineering Design Process and follow it as they document work and solve problems.</p>

																				<p><b>1557: Advanced Technology & Engineering</b><br>This course is only available to students who have previously completed Technology and Engineering (1547). Advanced Technology and Engineering is building off of knowledge learned in a students first year, taking Technology and Engineering (1547). Activities in this course are more complex and require large blocks of time. Projects are also build off of the concepts of communication, transportation, construction, and manufacturing and may include electronics and programming microcontrollers, robotics, product design and development, engineering design, and modular construction.</p>

																				<p><b>1551: Advanced Engineering Design</b><br>Advanced Engineering Design will use the basic skills learned in Technical Drawing and Design (1542) to create solutions to complicated engineering problems. This course will emphasize the engineering method, a process for developing designs, which will be used to create working prototypes. Some of the various activities are 3D printing, creating clay automobiles, using a wind tunnel, and designing a project that fits the human body.
																				</p>

																				<p><b>1553: Advanced Materials Engineering</b><br>This class is for students who want to further their education in manufacturing. The opportunity to design and build more complex objects and dig deeper into the creation of these products will be offered in this course. Students will also explore cutting edge technologies such as CNC and 3D printing honing in on a students skills as a maker.</p>
