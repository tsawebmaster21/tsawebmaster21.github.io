									<h2 align="middle">Chapter Information</h2>
									<p align="middle">Boyertown Senior High School TSA was founded in 1989. Members of this chapter are held to the high standard created by BASH TSA, and follow the high expectations and specific guidelines which are consistent throughout all TSA chapters. </p>
									<br>
									<p align="middle">Members of the chapter are required to attend mandatory meetings on the first Wednesday of every month to discuss business, and are expected to frequently attend work days on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Students are responsible for paying all fees and dues, along with participating in fundraising efforts. Proper TSA attire must be worn by members at competitions, and the rules set in place by both TSA, the advisor, and the school are to be followed at all times.<p>
									<p align="middle">Boyertown High School TSA requires students to attend the regional and state conferences, and to compete in no less than three events. </p>
									<br>
									<h2 align="middle">Chapter Leadership</h2>
									<p align="middle">Any member who has been involved in TSA is eligible to apply for an office within our chapter. To apply, a member fills out a packet with prompts regarding their goals for the chapter and individual ability. The chapter advisor then chooses an officer team, which works hard throughout the year. Boyertown officer team meets occasionally during free period to discuss chapter business. </p>
