										<h2>What is TSA?</h2>
										<p>TSA (Technology Student Association) is a national organization dedicated to creating future leaders in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. The organization uses its yearly set of competitions to test the abilities of the students competing in the event. In addition to expanding their knowledge, the members are able to represent their school and community when competing.
											<br><br><br>The TSA motto “learning to lead in a technical world” is precisely what the organization is working towards, as the club has opened branches in 48 of the 50 states. The overall mission of TSA is to have the members of the club learn and develop their skills in the STEM department and to eventually implement them on solutions towards the world’s most concerning problems.</p>

										<h2>The TSA Creed</h2>
										<p>I believe that Technology Education holds an important place in my life in the technical world. I believe there is a need for the development of good attitudes concerning work, tools, materials, experimentation, and processes of industry. Guided by my teachers, artisans from industry, and my own initiative, I will strive to do my best in making my school, community, state, and nation better places in which to live.<br><br>
												I will accept the responsibilities that are mine. I will accept the theories that are supported by proper evidence. I will explore on my own for safer, more effective methods of working and living. I will strive to develop a cooperative attitude and will exercise tact and respect for other individuals. Through the work of my hands and mind, I will express my ideas to the best of my ability. I will make it my goal to do better each day the task before me, and to be steadfast in my belief in my God, and my fellow Americans.
